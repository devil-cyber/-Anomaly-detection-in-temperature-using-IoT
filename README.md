# - Motivation for this project:
With the advancement in technology, IoT is the "next big thing!" With increased demand of automation and smart appliances at theindustry level as well as at personal home level, IoT is serving the need to make the objects smart.

This project is an evident example of IoT in action. The project deals with the sensing of temperature with the help of LM35 in any industry level, say any

pharmaceutical company where it is important to maintain a particular temperature, if temperature increased by a single degree will lead to a huge loss

so it become an important to moniter the temperature

his project deals with that problem. Whenever the temperature crosses a certain threshold, our Bolt Wifi Module will start its magic. The modules' job is to inform the owner about the anomaly.
